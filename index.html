        <h4 class="article-title">What is semantic HTML?</h4>
        <p class="article-body">
          Semantic HTML refers to the notion that your code should be reabable,
          it's all well and fine when it's just you working on a project, but
          what about a whole team, we all can't use divs for everything, imagine
          the chaos of trying to sift through hundreds of divs, albeit you could
          use a find feature, but there are better ways, mostly it should become
          a habit, but mostly developers these days are expected to write
          semantic HTML right out of the gate. This way, people who join the
          project later can at least navigate the code with moderate ease,
          there's nothing wrong with divs, they have their uses, mainly we use
          divs inside of other semantically labelled elements, to divide up
          content.
        </p>
        <p class="article-body">
          Although some opt out of using divs entirely and use a section
          element, as section, the word has a semantic meaning, I use divs to
          create actual dividers, inside of sections. So what are we talking
          about when we say semantic HTML, well, there are so many semantic
          elements, it would be impossible for me to cover them all, but
          basically you want to use an element that has a tag that is more
          descriptive in relation to the type of content it holds, for instance
          a header or footer tag, a nav element for your page navigation,
          article for collections of information, a figure to holds images and
          relevant info, i think you get the idea, these elements don't do much
          except act like divs, but at a glance you can understand what that
          piece of code is doing by it's element.
        </p>
        <p class="article-body">
          Look at the code snippet below, imagine, you are asked to perform a
          task or debug a system, then you see a function like this, sure, it's
          a function, what it does though, is anyone's guess, the same can be
          said for a file full of divs, you could read the classes but some divs
          dont have a class, some have multiple, it would be much easier to swap
          out the name div for a more semantic name.
